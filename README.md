# linux_customizations
A compilation of customizations for Debian-based Linux distrubutions (mostly Pop!_OS and Kali Linux) and (finally) a mostly automated script to put everything in place.

## What's it do?
Here's what the automated script does:
1. Checks for and install Gnome desktop environment
2. Creates a ~/git directory with a symlink from /git -> ~/git for convenience
3. Clones this repository for support dotfiles, etc to ~/git
4. Installs Oh My Zsh with the Powerlevel10k theme, autosuggestions and syntax highlighting plugins
    - Type `exit` after the Zsh shell loads to exit zsh and continue the script
5. Apt installs a number of my commonly used packages
    - Along with Zenmap for occasionaly usage (Zenmap as Root application shortcut isn't currently working, but sudo -E zenmap does.)
6. Git clones a number of my commonly used repos and installs/configures as needed
7. Installs Gnome extensions
    - Applicaiton Menu and Places Indicator extensions are disabled and will not enable via Tweaks, use Dconf-Editor, dconf, or gnome-extensions to enable and then they can be enabled/disabled from Tweaks
8. Copies dotfiles and applies customizations via gsettings
    - Wallpaper, favorite apps, keybindings, disables emoji shortcut key for compatibility with Terminator, sets themes
9. Installs a number of my commonly used Firefox extensions

# Reasons
This started as an idea due to setting up a new VM with everything took time. Sure, I could use the default settings and install things as I needed them, but it also presented a fun project for a real-world issue... Boom! Learning opportunity.
